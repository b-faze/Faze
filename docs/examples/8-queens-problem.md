# 8 Queens Problem

> The [**eight queens puzzle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is the problem of placing eight [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) [queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_%28chess%29) on an 8Ã—8 [chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard) so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Pipeline Summary

### Data Pipeline

```csharp
ReversePipelineBuilder.Create()
    .SaveTree(EightQueensProblemExhaustiveDataPipeline.Id, treeDataProvider)
    .Map(resultsMapper)
    .LimitDepth(3)
    .GameTree(new SquareTreeAdapter(BoardSize))
    .Build(() => new PiecesBoardState(new PiecesBoardStateConfig(BoardSize, new QueenPiece(), onlySafeMoves: true)));
```

### Render Pipeline

```csharp
ReversePipelineBuilder.Create()
    .GallerySave(galleryService, galleryMetaData)
    .Render(new SquareTreeRenderer(rendererConfig))
    .Paint(painter)
    .LoadTree(EightQueensProblemExhaustiveDataPipeline.Id, treeDataProvider);
```

## Pipeline Breakdown

### Game

The game rules are handled by the `PiecesBoardState` type using the following configuration:

| Property | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dimension | 8 | Size of the board |
| Piece | QueenPiece |  |
| OnlySafeMoves | true | Game state will only return moves that do not attack existing queens |

### ResultsMapper

Next the results mapper \(`EightQueensProblemSolutionTreeMapper`\) will take the game tree and transform it into a tree containing the results we can use generate the visualisation. In this case we are given a game tree 3 moves deep and then collect our results using the `EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate` type.

```csharp
private static Tree<EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate> MapTreeAgg(Tree<IGameState<GridMove, SingleScoreResult?>> tree)
{
    if (tree == null)
        return null;


    if (tree.IsLeaf())
    {
        var resultAgg = AggregateResults(tree.Value);
        return new Tree<EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate>(resultAgg);
    }

    var children = tree.Children.Select(x => MapTreeAgg(x)).ToList();

    var treeValue = new EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate();    
    foreach (var childValue in children.Where(x => x != null).Select(x => x.Value))
    {
        treeValue.Add(childValue);
    }

    return new Tree<EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate>(treeValue, children);
}
```

### Tree Painter

We then have a tree painter \(`EightQueensProblemPainter`\) which maps the results tree into a colour tree. 

```csharp
private Tree<Color> Paint(Tree<EightQueensProblemSolutionAggregate> tree, TreeMapInfo info, uint maxSiblingWins)
{
    if (tree == null)
    {
        return info.Parent.ChildIndex == info.ChildIndex 
            ? null 
            : new Tree<Color>(Color.Black);
    }

    var value = maxSiblingWins > 0 
        ? (double)tree.Value.Wins / maxSiblingWins 
        : 0;
        
    var color = value > 0 
        ? colorInterpolator.GetColor(value) 
        : Color.Black;

    if (tree.IsLeaf())
        return new Tree<Color>(color);

    var maxChildrenWins = tree.Children.Where(c => c != null).Select(x => x.Value.Wins).Max();
    var children = tree.Children.Select((c, i) => Paint(c, info.Child(i), maxChildrenWins));

    return new Tree<Color>(color, children);
}
```

The EightQueensProblemPainter normalises the number of wins of a tree node against the maximum value of its siblings. 

E.g. if we have 3 child nodes: \[100, 10, 50\], the normalised result will be \[100/100, 10/100, 50/100\] or \[1, 0.1, 0.5\]

The [GoldInterpolator](../rendering/color-interpolators.md#gold) then takes this normalised value and converts it to a colour.

All unavailable moves will be coloured black, with the exception of moves that are the same as the previous. The relevant code segment is here:

```csharp
    if (tree == null)
    {
        return info.Parent.ChildIndex == info.ChildIndex 
            ? null 
            : new Tree<Color>(Color.Black);
    }
```

Returning a null node instead which will be ignored by the renderer.  This means the null nodes will be coloured according to the parent's results which acts like a summary at each depth:

### Tree Renderer

The `SquareTreeRenderer` fits very nicely with this type of problem as it is played on a 8x8 board.

| :--- | :--- |
| MaxDepth | 1, 2 and 3 |
