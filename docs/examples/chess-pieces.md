# Chess Pieces

Similar to the [8 Queens Problem](8-queens-problem.md), the following images show the ways in which single chess pieces can be placed on increasing board sizes, such that each piece is not being attacked by another. However, unlike the 8 Queens Problem which has a solution, the following images are only coloured by the depth, rather than the number of solutions.

The following images show the different ways each piece can be placed on a 3x3 and 4x4 board.
