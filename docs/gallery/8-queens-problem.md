> The **eight queens puzzle** is the problem of placing eight [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) [queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_%28chess%29) on an 8Ã—8 [chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard) so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
